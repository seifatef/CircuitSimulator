Project Type: University Circuit Analysis Project

Overview
This repository contains a DC circuit simulator developed as part of a course project. The tool is designed to solve, analyze, and interpret direct current (DC) circuit problems. By providing component values and configuration details, users can:

Calculate node voltages and branch currents
Determine power dissipation in components
Visualize and analyze circuit behavior under various conditions
This simulator was created by two undergraduate students as a practical application of theoretical concepts learned in their circuits class.

Features
Node and Loop Analysis: Efficiently computes node voltages and loop currents using standard circuit analysis techniques.
Component Support: Handles resistors, voltage sources, current sources, and dependent sources (if applicable).
Power Calculations: Easily obtain power dissipation or generation within individual components.
Scalable: Add more components or modify circuit parameters to study different configurations without modifying core logic.
