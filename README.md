# DC Circuit Simulator

**Authors:** [Seif Atef Moussa], [Seif Hesham Abdelmomem]  
**Project Type:** University Circuit Analysis Project

## Overview

This repository contains a DC circuit simulator developed as part of a course project. The tool is designed to solve, analyze, and interpret direct current (DC) circuit problems. By providing component values and configuration details, users can:

- Calculate node voltages and branch currents
- Determine power dissipation in components
- Visualize and analyze circuit behavior under various conditions

This simulator was created by two undergraduate students as a practical application of theoretical concepts learned in their circuits class.

## Features

- **Node and Loop Analysis:** Efficient computation of node voltages and loop currents using standard circuit analysis techniques.
- **Component Support:** Handles resistors, voltage sources, current sources, and dependent sources (if applicable).
- **Power Calculations:** Easily obtains power dissipation or generation within individual components.
- **Scalability:** Add more components or modify circuit parameters to study different configurations without altering the core logic.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Programming language/environment (e.g., Python 3.x)  
- Required dependencies (if any, e.g., `numpy`)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/dc-circuit-simulator.git
   cd dc-circuit-simulator
